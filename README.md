This is a clone of the Google homepage as part of The Odin Project's curriculum.

In this project I will be working with HTML and CSS basics to clone the Google homepage.
I used the developer tools while building this page to tweak my version to look more like the original by adjusting the values for my page's attributes. I also tried not to spy on Google's code, so I inspected my own elements by looking at their page on one tab and editing my own in the other.

P.S. I didn't know how to use git well when I started the project, that's why there aren't any earlier versions.
